# Fingerprinter

Welcome to the *Fingerprinter* project. The main purpose of this project is to provide a proof-of-concept implementation
 of some remote operating system fingerprinting methods. It is also planned to create an implementation of a cloud provider 
 detection mechanism based on TCP/IP networking. This repository is part of my thesis to receive my bachelor's degree in 
 computer sciences from `Fernfachhochschule Schweiz (FFHS)`. My thesis can be found at [Link following](https://#).
