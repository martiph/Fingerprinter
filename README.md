# Fingerprinter

Welcome to the *Fingerprinter* project. The main purpose of this project is to provide a proof-of-concept implementation of some remote operating system fingerprinting methods. It is also planned to create an implementation of a cloud provider detection mechanism based on TCP/IP networking. This repository is part of my thesis to receive my bachelor's degree in computer sciences from `Fernfachhochschule Schweiz (FFHS)`. My thesis can be found at [Link is following](https://#).
  
## Installation

First, make sure you have `python-3.8` (including `pip`) locally installed and added to your PATH. Then clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/martiph/Fingerprinter`) onto your local machine and create a python virtual environment (virtualenv). To install all necessary packages, activate the virtualenv and run `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`. Probably you will need to alter the command slightly. For example if you work on a linux-system, you probably need to use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

`requirements.txt` was generated after development using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## Usage

TBD
